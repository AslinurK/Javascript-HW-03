Started the project
Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code.

It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
